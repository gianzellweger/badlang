This project originated from a place of frustration. 

I'm not that old yet*. I grew up with technology, and even at a young age I was frustrated by lacking technology. I looked at enormously long loading times, lacking music players, and ad-ridden apps and didn't understand why they were this way. 
This frustration only increased as I became a developer, now knowing it could be done better. 

The real reason things are like they are in tech space today is one thing: money.

You can't get around it. Everybody needs to earn money to survive in our current Western society**. But actively making a product worse just to make another billionaire's wallet a bit fatter is too much. Subscriptions, 
always-online services (that don't actually need it), personal data collection, ad-avalanches, the list goes on.

I talked with some friends (who are not developers but rather users) about this deep, year-long frustration and we verbally compiled a list that is a very reduced version of [this list](https://github.com/gianzellweger/badlang/issues/3).

I then wondered why we hold programming languages to a different standard than more traditional user-oriented applications. So I began to think about writing a small demo that was very hard coded and would probably have been done in a weekend 
and then showing this demo to my aforementioned friends, but then I thought "Why not write the real deal?".

I decided to write a stack-based language because it is quite easy to parse and after one or two intense afternoons, I was done with the core language part. But that was not the important part. See, I wrote this programming language in Rust.
That is not only because I like Rust, but it also has an extremely extensive ecosystem probably only topped by JavaScript with Node. Rust devs are willing to write everything in their favorite language.

So I took advantage of that and started collecting. I thought back and tried to remember the verbal list between me and my friends. I remembered my hatred towards many aspects of software with more than 10 years of experience as a user and more than 4 years as a developer.
I started coding, and I just kept going for the most part. I remembered more things that frustrated me about modern software. I knew I would never be finished as there would always be more frustrating things but I tried my best.

And I started noticing that I was walking quite a thin line between good parody and downright frustrating. Since my program(ming language) serves almost no practical purpose other than being a parody, users have no reason to stick around,
meaning I couldn't make my "features" too mean, because otherwise, users would leave and miss out on half the fun.

So far, this has been my mission. You can't buy this programming language, donate to me, or buy any merch of it. If that were to change, it would probably affect the latter two, as this programming language will always remain free.
Also, if you have privacy concerns with this programming language, don't worry. Most things are either:
* just entirely fake and do nothing.
* real, but the data they retrieve is either not relevant or just not saved at all.
* handled with utmost care.

Still, do not type any sensitive data anywhere as security breaches can always happen.

<sup>*Real age redacted for privacy reasons and out of laziness of having to update it every year. And yes, I am indeed one person who is driving everything behind this project.</sup>

<sup>**Whether that is a good concept or not will not be tackled in this document.</sup>
