# BadLang™ - The future of programming

This language isn't just the next trend - it's the future. You've heard of "Rewrite it in Rust". Soon you will hear "Rewrite it in BadLang™" (The ™ is pronounced).

This language features the newest paradigm: Stack-based programming. You've heard of imperative, you've heard of functional, but have you heard of stack-based? It was established in 1970 by the Forth language, so probably not.

## Examples

### Basic example

This programming language is stack based:
```
69 drop
```
This revolutionary blazingly fast example shows the grace of stack-based programming.

### Hello world

There is no Hello World in BadLang™. Why would you want such an inefficient program that does nothing?

---

### Addition

Addition is where this program really shines! We can add two, even three numbers! Bet your C can't do that!
```
34 35 + print
```
Or with three numbers:
```
20 23 26 + + print
```

### Comments

There are no comments in BadLang™. All code written in Badlang™ is self-documenting.
